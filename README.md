# Canadian Household Analysis

This project analyzes the behavior of Canadian households using the DemoStats 2024 and HouseholdSpend 2024 datasets provided by Environics Analytics.

## üìä Objective
To cluster Canadian households based on their demographic and spending behavior and visualize meaningful patterns using machine learning and dimensionality reduction techniques.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- K-Means Clustering
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- Silhouette Analysis

## Files
- `Code.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all data processing, clustering, and visualization.
- `Canadian_Household_Analysis.pdf`: Final written report summarizing the methodology, findings, and conclusions.

## Key Highlights
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw household data (handled missing values, outliers, and scaling)
- Determined optimal number of clusters using both the Elbow Method and Silhouette Scores
- Applied K-Means clustering to segment household profiles
- Used PCA to reduce dimensionality and visualize cluster separation

## Results
- Identified clear segments within Canadian households based on demographic and spending behavior
- Visualizations revealed distinct patterns across clusters
- Recommendations provided for targeting households based on these insights

## Learnings
- Gained hands-on experience in clustering and PCA
- Practiced proper data cleaning, EDA, and visualization techniques
- Learned to interpret unsupervised learning results in a real-world context
